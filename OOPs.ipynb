        "***Q1.  What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?***\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. It uses concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism to model real-world entities and their interactions.\n",

        "\n",
        "***Q2. What is a class in OOP?***\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior of objects, including their data (attributes) and actions (methods).\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "***Q3. What is an object in OOP?***\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. In OOP an object is a fundamental building block, representing an instance of a class. It encapsulates both data (attributes) and the code (methods) that operate on that data.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "***Q4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?***\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Abstraction focuses on presenting essential information while hiding unnecessary details, while encapsulation bundles data and methods and restricts direct access to protect data integrity.\n",

        "***Q5. What are dunder methods in Python?***\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Dunder methods, also known as magic methods, are special methods in Python that begin and end with double underscores (e.g., __init__, __str__, __len__). They provide a way to define how objects of a class should behave with built-in operators and functions. These methods enable operator overloading and customization of object behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "***Q6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.***\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Inheritance in (OOP) is a mechanism that allows a class (called a subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (called a superclass or base class). This promotes code reuse, establishes hierarchical relationships between classes, and simplifies the development process.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "***Q7. What is polymorphism in OOP?***\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. In OOP polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type, enabling flexible and reusable code. It essentially means \"many forms,\" allowing the same method name to be used for different actions depending on the object type.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "***Q8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?***\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Encapsulation in Python is achieved through access modifiers and property decorators. Access modifiers control the visibility of class members, while property decorators allow controlled access to attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "***Q9. What is a constructor in Python?***\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. A constructor in Python is a special method used to initialize objects of a class. It is automatically called when an object is created. The constructor's primary purpose is to set up the initial state of the object by assigning values to its attributes or performing other setup tasks. In Python, the constructor is named __init__ .\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "1. Class methods are bound to the class and not the instance of the class. They receive the class itself as the first argument, conventionally named cls. Class methods are defined using the @classmethod decorator. They can access and modify class-level attributes but cannot modify instance-specific attributes.\n",
        "2. Static methods are not bound to the class or the instance. They do not receive any implicit first argument. They are essentially functions that are defined within the scope of a class. Static methods are defined using the @staticmethod decorator. They cannot access or modify class or instance attributes directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "***Q11. What is method overloading in Python?***\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Method overloading in Python refers to the ability to define multiple methods with the same name within a class, but with different parameters. If you define multiple methods with the same name, the last defined method will override any earlier definitions.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "***Q12. What is method overriding in OOP?***\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. In OOP method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. This enables the subclass to modify or extend the behavior of the inherited method while maintaining the same method signature like name , parameter ,etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "***Q13. What is a property decorator in Python?***\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. A property decorator is a built-in feature that allows methods to be accessed like attributes. It provides a way to encapsulate the logic for getting, setting, and deleting an attribute within a class, while still allowing access to it using the familiar dot notation. The @property decorator is used to define the \"getter\" method.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "***Q14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?***\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Polymorphism is crucial in OOP because it enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type, promoting code reusability, flexibility, and maintainability. It allows for a single interface to be used for different operations, while each class can implement it in its own specific way.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "***Q15. What is an abstract class in Python?***\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and serves as a blueprint for other classes. It defines a common interface for a group of subclasses, ensuring that they implement specific methods. Abstract classes are created using the abc module, and they may contain abstract methods, which are declared but not implemented in the abstract class. Subclasses are required to provide concrete implementations for these abstract methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "***Q16. What are the advantages of OOP?***\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. OOP offers several advantages, primarily enhancing code organization, reusability, and maintainability. Key benefits include modularity, code reuse through inheritance, flexibility with polymorphism, and simplified problem-solving. These advantages make OOP particularly useful for developing large, complex software systems.\n",
        "\n",

        "***Q17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?***\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "1. Class Variables (Static Variables):\n",
        "* Defined at the class level (outside any methods) and typically using the static keyword (in languages like Java).\n",
        "* Share a single copy across all instances of the class.\n",
        "* Can be accessed directly using the class name (e.g., MyClass.myVariable).\n",
        "* Used for shared data, constants, or when you need a single copy for all instances.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Instance Variables:\n",
        "* Defined at the instance level within a class (typically within the constructor ).\n",
        "* Each instance (object) of the class has its own separate copy of the instance variable.\n",
        "* Accessed using an object reference (e.g., myObject.myVariable).\n",
        "Used to store unique data specific to each object, like properties or characteristics of that particular instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "***Q18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?***\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Multiple inheritance in Python is a feature that allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. This enables a class to combine functionalities from different sources, promoting code reuse and flexibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "***Q19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.***\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. The __ str __ and __ repr __ methods in Python are special methods used to define how objects should be represented as strings.\n",
        "1. __ str __ :  This method is meant to return a human-readable, informal string representation of an object. It is called by the built-in str() function and implicitly by the print() function. The goal of __str__ is to provide a string that is easily understood by end-users.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. __ repr __ : This method is meant to return an unambiguous, formal string representation of an object. It is called by the built-in repr() function and is also used in the interactive interpreter. The goal of __repr__ is to provide a string that can be used to recreate the object, or at least provide detailed information about it for debugging purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "***Q20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?***\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent class in a subclass. It provides a way to access and utilize inherited behavior while also allowing for customization or extension of that behavior in the subclass. Its primary significance lies in enabling proper inheritance and promoting code reusability in object-oriented programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "***Q21. What is the significance of the __ del __ method in Python?***\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. The __ del __ method in Python, also known as a destructor, defines actions to be performed when an object is garbage collected. It's called automatically when all references to an object have been deleted, and the object is about to be destroyed. The primary purpose of __ del __ is to facilitate resource cleanup, such as closing files or releasing external connections.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "***Q22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?***\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "1. @staticmethod : This decorator designates a method that does not receive any implicit arguments, neither the instance (self) nor the class (cls). It behaves like a regular function, but it is logically grouped within the class scope. Static methods cannot access or modify the class or instance state. They are often used for utility functions that are related to the class but don't depend on its specific instances.\n",
        "2. @classmethod : This decorator defines a method that receives the class (cls) as the first argument, instead of the instance (self). It can access and modify class-level attributes but cannot access instance-specific attributes. Class methods are frequently used for factory methods, which create instances of the class, or for operations that involve the class itself rather than a particular instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "***Q23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?***\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Polymorphism, meaning \"many forms,\" enables objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in their own specific ways. When combined with inheritance in Python, polymorphism allows subclasses to override or implement methods of their parent class, leading to flexible and adaptable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "***Q24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?***\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Method chaining in Python is a programming technique used in OOP to call multiple methods sequentially on the same object. It enhances code readability and conciseness by eliminating the need for intermediate variables. To enable method chaining, each method in the sequence must return the object instance itself. This allows the subsequent method to be called directly on the result of the previous one.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "***Q25. What is the purpose of the __ call __ method in Python?***\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. The __ call __ method in Python enables instances of a class to be called like regular functions. When a class defines the __ call __ method, its instances become callable objects. This means that you can use parentheses to \"call\" the object, and the code within the __ call __ method will be executed.\n",
